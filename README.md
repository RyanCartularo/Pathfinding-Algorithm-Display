# Pathfinding Algorithm Display

Hi thanks for checking out my project! this is a web-based application that I made. 
If you would like to play with the program I have hosted it using firebase! Here is the [link](https://pathfinding-algorithm-display.web.app/)

## Summary of The Project

The main goal of the Pathfinding Algorithm Display was to make a program the could be a visual aid to help people understand how pathfinding algorithms work.
The display uses a grid known as a Manhattan Distance Grid, which means that unlike some grids, there is no weight associated with any nodes; so all nodes are exactly
the same but feature a different address.
As the program is right now it only features two different algorithms, the classic Dijkstra's Algorithm and The Breadth First Algorithm, but there is plenty of room for expansion
in future releases.

One key feature of the program is the ability to add walls which the algorithms will see and be unable to go through. This feature makes it possible for users to create mazes
for the algorithms to try and traverse.

As you can see here the mazes can get quite complex and quite fun.
